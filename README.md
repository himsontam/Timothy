Introduction
This is a cross platform mobile application, called “Timothy” created for ECC Timothy
Fellowship Church. This mobile application is created by ionic framework as front end and
Firebase as backend.
As my minor is information technology and entrepreneurship, this project can let me
work with a customer and make a mobile application based on their customer requirement.
That’s the best experience for me to work with customer in business communication and
requirement.

Background
This mobile application was created for ECC Timothy Fellowship Church. Timothy are
students studying at community college and universities in Seattle and neighboring cities. We
have this fellowship for all language Speaking students who love to meet together to study the
Bible, sing praise and worship songs, and attend valued workshops. Timothy want to help one
another know more about Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord. We also want to encourage one
another to grow in the Lord, as stated in 1 Timothy 4:12 “Don’t let anyone look down on you
because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith
and purity.

For the application architecture, it is including 8 pages, which are Sign-in Page, Signup
Page, Home Page, Calendar Page, Photo Page, Media Page, Prayer List Page, and About page as
follows:

● Sign-In Page and Signup Page: using Firebase Authentication. Firebase
Authentication provides backend services easy to use SDKs, and ready-made UI
libraries to authenticate users to our mobile application. This project is using
Firebase Authentication with email and password as a sign-up and sign- in
method.

1. Announcements connect with Google Blogger RSS API for getting

photo id to display in our project mobile application.
